CHANNEL MODES :

for users :
    # - O : channel creator
    - o : channel operator
    - v : voice

for channels :
    i - toggle the invite-only channel flag - new members are only accepted if they match invite-list or if an operator invites them. Restricts the usage of INVITE command.
    m - toggle the moderated channel - only channel operators and voice privileged members can send messages.
  D n - toggle the no messages to channel from clients on the outside - only members can send messages.
    p - toggle the private channel flag - name of the channel cannot be acquired from the servers if not a member. Omitted from queries like WHOIS.
  D t - toggle the topic settable by channel operator only flag - restricts the usage of TOPIC command to operators.
    k - set/remove the channel key (password) - servers reject requests to join the channel unless the key is given. Key is given to members after a MODE query.
    l - set/remove the user limit to channel - when the limit is reached, servers forbid their local users from joining. Limit is given to members after a MODE query


    # Access control:
    # b - set/remove ban mask to keep users out - if a user tries to join, his user checks whether his addresses the ban mask and if so forbids him from joining unless he is also on an exception mask.
    # e - set/remove an exception mask to override a ban mask
    # if a user has been banned, he can be reinvited by an operator and rejoin. Cannot speak on the channel unless he is an operator or has voice privilege.
    # I - set/remove an invitation mask to automatically override the invite-only flag - users whose addresses match the mask can join the channel without invitation.
